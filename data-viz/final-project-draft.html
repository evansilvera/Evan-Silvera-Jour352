<p>Upon the dawn of the new century, Amazon CEO and Founder Jeffrey Bezos wrote in a annual letter to shareholders, “Our vision is to use this platform to build Earth’s most customer-centric company, a place where customers can come to find and discover anything and everything they might want to buy online,” according to the company’s 1999 archive.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, the e-commerce titan’s philosophy remains, but its customers have undergone profound change. We live in a world where instant gratification — the expectation for immediate outcomes — is the mindset that prevails and dictates consumer behavior.</p>

<p>Amazon delivers instant gratification.</p>

<p>“Today, we all feel a poverty of time,” said Mary Harms, professor of digital marketing at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. “That’s been going on for some time, and Amazon tapped into that and maybe even increased it.”</p>

<p>With one click, Amazon offers free one-day and two-day shipping on millions of products for Prime customers. Since its acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017, Amazon provides two-hour shipping on groceries and other “daily essential” items. Customers can even opt for “key in-car” or “key in-home” delivery.</p>

<p>One of Amazon’s four guiding principles includes “customer obsession rather than competitor focus.” With this tenet in mind, Amazon spent $22.6 billion in 2017 —  more than any other company in the United States — on research and development into consumer preferences and expectations, according to Recode, an affiliate of Vox that covers Silicon Valley news.</p>

<p>Amazon’s investment in research and development pays off. From its inception in 1994, the online retail giant has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top of the e-commerce market.</p>

<p>Not only is Bezos the richest man in the world, but Amazon surpassed Microsoft as the world’s most valuable public company in January at $796.8 billion, CNBC reported. As of September 2018, an $1,000 investment in Amazon from 1997 would be worth $1.32 million, according to the CNBC report’s calculations.</p>

<p>A critical mass of Amazon’s profits come from third-party sellers, who represented only 3 percent of sales in 1999 and represented 58 percent in 2018, according to Bezos’ most recent letter to shareholders.</p>

<p>However, with Amazon’s growing success comes growing costs. In 2005, when Amazon Prime initially launched, a yearly subscription costed $79. The price increased in 2014 to $99 per year, and has now escalated to $119 annually, serving more than 100 million members around the globe.</p>

<p>“As their inventory grows, they keep increasing their prices, but we feel comfortable accepting that increase because they have expanded their product and services offerings,” Harms said.</p>

<p>While Harms said Amazon contributes positively to the e-commerce market by encouraging online retail as a whole, some key e-commerce players in the U.S. have struggled to keep up.</p>

<p>Trailing behind Amazon as the country’s second most profitable online business, eBay controlled almost 7 percent of e-commerce sales compared to Amazon’s 50 percent in 2018, an eMarketer report found. Following eBay is Walmart, which controlled nearly 4 percent of the e-commerce market in the same year, according to the report.</p>

<p>The eMarketer report shows Apple treading marginally behind Walmart, controlling just under 4 percent of the e-commerce market. Due to Amazon’s ever-changing retail landscape, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Macy’s, Costco and Wayfair are a handful of important retailers that control relatively small fractions of the e-commerce market.</p>

<p>In the book “Amazon: How the World’s Most Relentless Retailer will Continue to Revolutionize Commerce,” authors Natalie Berg and Miya Knights wrote, “to competitors, Amazon is ruthless and fearsome; to customers, Amazon is effortless and, increasingly, indispensable.”</p>

<p>Amazon’s prosperity and ability to deliver instant gratification, coupled with the losses some other major retailers have suffered as a result of the company’s exponential growth, makes it a formidable opponent in the world of e-commerce.</p>

<p>So, what’s stopping other e-commerce businesses from matching or surpassing Amazon?</p>

<p>To serve the consumer need for instant gratification, Amazon has invested in “geographically dispersed warehouses” — consisting of fulfillment and sortation centers — that make Prime’s two-day shipping feature achievable, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<iframe src="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/c6600de6fd61c8da0d6904dcb77894cb/amazon-fulfillment-and-sortation-centers/index.html" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="800"></iframe>

<p>It’s also Amazon’s tremendous scale and massive infrastructure that keep the operation viable, Christopher Mims explains in his WSJ article. It’ll take a business as great in size and scale as well as innovative power as Amazon to compete with it, Mims added.</p>

<p>But Bezos himself recognizes the risks associated with Amazon’s continued scaling and effort to remain the king of online retail.</p>

<p>“As a company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn’t growing, you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle,” Bezos wrote in his 2018 letter to shareholders. “This kind of large-scale risk taking is part of the service we as a large company can provide to our customers and to society.”</p>
